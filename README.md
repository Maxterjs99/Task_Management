# Task Management System
This is a simple command-line task management system implemented in Python. It allows users to add tasks with various details, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The program is modularized into different files for better organization.

# Features

2. View Tasks: Users can view a list of tasks with their details, including ID, name, description, priority, completion status, and start time.
3. View Task Names: Users can view only the names of the tasks for a quick overview.
4. Sort by Priority: Users can view tasks sorted by priority level.
5. Mark Tasks Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which changes their completion status.
6. Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks by selecting their ID.

# Usage

2. Choose options to add tasks, view tasks, view task names, sort tasks by priority, mark tasks as completed, or delete tasks.
